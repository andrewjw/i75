i75 documentation
==================================

i75 is a wrapper around the Pimoroni's interstate75 and PicoGraphics libraries.
It aims to add some additional functionality to make development for the interstate75 hardware
easier, but also to simulate the hardware so development can mostly take place on a normal pc,
and doesn't need constant deploying to physical hardware for testing.
